# Basketball_Stat_Search
My first Python Project! Extracting basketball player data from a database.
This program is intended to act as a blueprint for further data projects. It’s a simple program that pulls data from a csv according to a user input, cleans it using split, assigns it to a user-defined player class called “Player” and returns five parameters. It also incorporates a number of try statements - including when accessing the csv and when prompting for a user input.
The class contains private and public attributes and methods and provides unit tests for each defined method.
The goal of this project is to expand the database so that users may access basketball player info and statistics. At its most basic level, it can help solve further data problems moving forward.
